# Understanding fees on Carbonmark

It is **completely free** to purchase from a seller listing and pay with USDC. You can also create and manage listings at zero additional cost.

However, for other types of purchases, you may encounter **network fees** or **payment processing fees** from our partner technology providers. This document is intended to help you understand how these fees work, and where the money goes.

## Summary
### Payment method
| Payment Method | Network fees | Payment Processing fees |
|----------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| USDC           | 0-26%*       | 0%                      |
| Credit Card    | 0-26%*       | 20%                     |
**Network fees depend on purchase type, not payment method. See table below for more info on how network fees are determined.*
Our payment processing partners (Stripe & Offsetra) charge a 20% fee on top of the listed tonne price.


## Seller listing prices vs pool prices
Carbonmark compares prices across different sources in the Digital Carbon Market. Currently, we compare prices from two sources: *marketplace sellers*, and *carbon pools*. Fees depend on which source.

**Marketplace seller listings** are the prices set by sellers who have listed a specific asset for sale directly on our platform. There are zero network fees incurred for purchases from marketplace listings.

**Carbon pools** are like to 'index funds' for carbon assets. These pools contain a variety of carbon projects and vintages, but each pool has a single price-per-tonne that changes based on supply and demand. In addition to the trading price, purchasing or retiring an asset from a pool may incur a network fee (described in the next section). These pools are not operated by Carbonmark-- currently we have integrated with the carbon pools operated by C3 and Toucan. You can explore these pools and the carbon assets that they contain at [carbon.klimadao.finance](https://carbon.klimadao.finance/).

## Network fees vs payment processing fees
