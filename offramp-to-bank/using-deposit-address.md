# Using Deposit Address

## Overview

Once you have completed the [onboarding.md](onboarding.md "mention") process, you will have received a unique **Deposit Address** (0x...1234) that is exclusively linked to your Bridge customer ID and bank payment route. You can use that Deposit Address to facilitate the USDC --> Fiat offramp from the [Carbonmark app](https://forms.zohopublic.com/carbonmark/form/OfframptoBankRequest/formperma/l1l1dm5JWpRBREjJGrBJyiUjPVn2C9QwJogKMCFkJYQ).

## Process

1. Once the onboarding steps are complete, **Carbonmark** will send you an email with:
   1. **Deposit address** (i.e. 0x##...####).
   2. **Payment instructions PDF**; which includes the following information:
      1. `Chain` (i.e. Polygon)
      2. `Currency` (i.e. USDC)
      3. `Deposit address` (i.e.  0x##...####)
      4. Destination details (This is where the payment will land):
         1. `Destination payment rail`&#x20;
         2. `Destination currency`
         3. `Bank name`
         4. `Account owner`
         5. `Account type`
         6. `Other account details`
   3. A link to this **user guide**.
2. Login in your **Carbonmark** account and navigate to your [Carbon Portfolio](https://app.carbonmark.com/portfolio) page.
3. Under `Manage Assets`, click the **TRANSFER ASSETS** button.
4. In the `Transfer Assets` modal, set the following fields:
   1. `Destination`  This is the Deposit address from step #1.
   2. `Asset`  USDC
   3. `Quantity`  The amount of USDC to transfer to your bank account.
5. Click the **START TRANSFER..**. button and sign the transactions with your PIN number.
6. Ideally (but not required), send **Carbonmark** an email that an offramp transfer transaction has been executed. **Carbonmark** can confirm the transaction in the Bridge dashboard app.
7. Once the payment process is confirmed, the **Payment receipt** (generated from the Bridge dashboard app) can be sent to you by email.
