# Carbonmark FAQ

#### What is Carbonmark?

Carbonmark is a marketplace for the Digital Carbon Market (DCM). It gives buyers and sellers the ability to find each other easily and make trades immediately.\
\
Carbonmark is built on top of the same Web3-enabled technology stack as KlimaDAO, meaning that users are able to tap into the benefits that public blockchains bring to the carbon markets.\
\
It has no fees, is based on decentralized and permissionless technology, and above all prioritizes the user’s experience.\


#### What is the Digital Carbon Market?

The Digital Carbon Market (DCM) is a part of the wider Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM) that is hosted on public blockchains.\
\
The utilization of public blockchains for the VCM is beneficial for all market stakeholders as it can bring greater transparency, improve market efficiencies, lower transaction costs, and prioritize equitable market outcomes for all participants.\


#### How does Carbonmark work?

Holders of digital carbon credits can list their carbon credits on Carbonmark at a specified price. Carbonmark then works like any other marketplace: once the list price is met by a buyer, the sale will be executed and cleared immediately via a smart contract.\
\
If the buyer does not have sufficient funds to make a purchase, the transaction will be rejected, and the carbon credit will remain listed. By leveraging smart contract technologies, no third -parties are required to execute and clear trades.\


#### Who is holding and selling digital carbon credits on Carbonmark?

Anyone who has access to digital carbon will be able to sell on the marketplace. This could be one of a number of organizations:

* A carbon project developer who has bridged their carbon credits onto the Polygon blockchain and now holds carbon on-chain.
* Carbon market traders who have bridged untokenized carbon credits and acquired digital carbon credits from a liquidity pool.
* Carbon credit retailers who offer to retire digital carbon credits on behalf of their customers.
* Software companies who wish to offer carbon credits directly to customers, through seamless API integrations.

#### Can I retire (or “offset”) carbon credits via Carbonmark?

Yes. KlimaDAO’s Retirement Aggregator will be enabled on Carbonmark, meaning that users will be able to source and retire carbon credits directly via the Carbonmark website. Certificates and blockchain proofs for any carbon offset will be issued via Carbonmark.\


#### What carbon credits are available on Carbonmark?

Carbonmark enables any of the digital carbon credits that are available on the Polygon blockchain to be listed. Initially at launch, this will include digital carbon that has been issued by Moss, Toucan, and C3, including credits represented in the BCT, NCT, UBO, NBO, and MCO2 pools.\
\
As the digital carbon supply diversifies, additional forms of digital carbon will be made available on Carbonmark by users.\


#### Are there any fees associated with the Carbonmark marketplace?

No. Unlike other carbon marketplaces, there are no transaction fees associated with buying, selling, and retiring carbon on Carbonmark.\


#### What team is behind Carbonmark?

Carbonmark has been developed by [KlimaDAO](https://klimadao.finance) as a means to enable greater levels of adoption and integration with the Digital Carbon Market.\
\
The KlimaDAO protocol will continue to develop best-in-class open-source base layer infrastructure for the carbon markets, while Carbonmark itself will be the entry point for the majority of stakeholders seeking to source, trade, and retire carbon.
