# API Pricing and Billing

### [**For the most up-to-date pricing and billing information, see here.**](https://github.com/provideplatform/eco-api-resources/blob/main/billing\_setup/eco-api-billing.md)

## Pricing models

Provide ECO API offers two pricing models:

* **Fixed rate.** This allows the API user to acquire carbon retirements at a pre-determined fixed price set within the last 30 days.
* **Spot rate.** This determines pricing based on a small premium upon the current available market spot price for carbon offsets.

Pricing models are subject to user's submitted billing details and other factors.

Additional surcharges may apply for credit/debit card usage.
