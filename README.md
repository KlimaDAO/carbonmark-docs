# Overview

Carbonmark is the Universal Carbon Marketplace – an open-source, open carbon credit market for every organization in the world seeking to acquire, trade, or retire carbon.

We give carbon brokers, commodity traders, organizations of all sizes, and individuals the ability to buy tens of millions of carbon credits, via a marketplace that is built to prioritize user experience. With a huge range of vintages and categories – including Forestry, Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency, and Industrial Processing – Carbonmark offers credits able to meet the needs of buyers across the Voluntary Carbon Market via a seamless trading experience providing instant settlement and unparalleled data insights. Moreover, Carbonmark offers best-in-the-market pricing with no additional transaction fees.

If you’re a seller looking for buyers, we give project developers and holders of digital carbon unprecedented ease of access to the Digital Carbon Market. Carbonmark allows sellers to assign a specific price to their carbon assets and list them for sale in an open storefront until a buyer is found. These listings are displayed side-by-side with the projects in existing liquidity pools, meaning buyers always know they are getting the best deal and sellers know their prices are fair and competitive.

Launching with zero fees for both buyers and sellers, and built on top of KlimaDAO’s transparent, neutral, and public infrastructure, Carbonmark has been developed by KlimaDAO as a means to enable greater access to the opportunities of the Digital Carbon Market. Our mission is to build the largest, most accessible carbon marketplace, providing the digital infrastructure the Voluntary Carbon Market needs to fulfill its role in helping the world achieve net-zero carbon emissions over the coming decades.

Carbonmark is the Universal Carbon Marketplace, and your gateway to the Digital Carbon Market (DCM) – it gives you access to tens of millions of carbon credits, is built to prioritize your user experience, and utilizes the transparent and interoperable infrastructure designed and developed by KlimaDAO.

The goal of Carbonmark was to provide a seamless and easy to use marketplace interface, with four key functional areas.

#### Marketplace

The Marketplace shows all the projects available to browse in a dashboard format. Each project card indicates the project title, a short description, vintage year, category, and best available price. Artwork banner images align with project categories to assist in identifying projects of interest.

<figure><img src="https://www.carbonmark.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fdk34t4vc%2Fproduction%2Faa8be41298ed2c6493df55b5288c83f4737f4dab-2732x1060.png&#x26;w=1920&#x26;q=75" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Scroll the projects or use the search / filter tools to constrain the projects shown.

Search with any term (case insensitive) and click enter or search icon.

Filter results by (1) County (2) Category (3) Vintage or any combination of these options.

Within Filters, the projects can also be sorted with options for Price, Recently Updated, and Vintage.

Once a project of interest has been found, click the card to see the project details.

#### Project details page

Each project has its own details page. Here you will find information on methodology, a map showing generalized location, and the full project description.

<figure><img src="https://www.carbonmark.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fdk34t4vc%2Fproduction%2F2d71ed985826e398f915a8c32523041afd8460d0-2092x1268.png&#x26;w=1920&#x26;q=75" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Below the basic project information, there will be Listings, Stats (retirements vs remaining supply data), and an Activity thread of last five transactions on the project.

Listings can be from a Carbon Pool or from an individual or organization seller (i.e. Seller Listing). A project may therefore have multiple listings at different price points.

A Carbon Pool listing will indicate the unit price (per tonne), the digital carbon pool, and the quantity available. Carbon pool listings can be bought or retired from the listing.

A Seller Pool listing will also include a Created and Updated date (if applicable). Seller pool listings can be bought from the listing.

#### Profile page

To create and sell project listings and fully participate in the Marketplace, a connected Carbonmark profile is required.

<figure><img src="https://www.carbonmark.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fdk34t4vc%2Fproduction%2F0de5a392c23d6c173ddc4ebe8e799ea14ab980d7-2048x926.png&#x26;w=1920&#x26;q=75" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Clicking Login will show the Login modal where you can connect using your favorite social or email account or if preferred an existing wallet.

Once logged in and on your Profile page, it is recommended to edit your seller profile with a (1) username/handle (2) display name (3) profile picture and (4) a short description about yourself or organization.

The Profile page is where you can Create and Edit listings (note that a fully completed profile is required to create a listing). [Learn how to create a profile.](get-started/how-to-create-and-edit-your-carbonmark-profile.md)

The Profile page also includes seller data Stats (tonnes sold, tonnes listed, active listings) and an Activity thread of the last five transactions.

#### Portfolio page

The Portfolio page shows all of the listable assets found in the connected wallet. You must have a fully completed Profile to have access to the Portfolio feature.

In the Balances section of the page, other assets like USDC will be shown.

As with the Profile page, seller data Stats and and an Activity thread of the last five transactions are shown.

For each of the assets listed in your portfolio, the project name, category, vintage, and quantity available are shown on the asset card.

Assets can be retired or sold (create listing) from the Portfolio page.
