6. Accept the necessary permissions for the Carbonmark app and click `Install`.  \

6. A popup will inform you that the transfer has been requested successfully. Click the link contained in that message to be taken directly to your organization's ICR inventory.&#x20;

6. Click the mentioned `Accept` button.
7. You will see a message which asks you once more to `Accept` the transfer. Once you click the button, the request will be fulfilled and the credits will be sent to the address highlighted on the screenshot below (which should be your Carbonmark Wallet address).&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
**IMPORTANT**: **If credits are sent to an incorrect Carbonmark Wallet address**, those credits are <mark style="color:red;">**irretrievable**</mark>.&#x20;

While the correct address should be selected automatically by our systems, <mark style="color:red;">**PLEASE**</mark> <mark style="color:red;">**double check the account address**</mark> shown to you to confirm you have control of that account address. When in doubt, issue a request for a small amount first to confirm the connection. The smallest amount you can request is 0.001 credits.
