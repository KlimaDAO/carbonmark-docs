# Onboarding

## Overview

Carbonmark has partnered with [https://www.bridge.xyz/](https://www.bridge.xyz/) (a **Stripe** company) to provide a convenient, simple, and transparent process to offramp USDC stablecoins from a Carbonmark Seller account to fiat in a bank account of the sellers choice.

## Process

{% hint style="success" %}
### Future State - Managed in Carbonmark

In 2026, Carbonmark will improve the UX for this feature by managing the process via UI interfaces within Carbonmark, leveraging the the Bridge development platform and API.
{% endhint %}

In the short term, Carbonmark will offer an OTC service and coordinate the steps with our sellers to generate payment routes (i.e. deposit addresses) which facilitate the transfer of USDC to a bank account. All of the Bridge related steps are conducted within our secure Bridge Dashboard application.

### Onboarding steps:

1. Login in to your **Carbonmark account** and navigate to the [Carbon Portfolio](https://app.carbonmark.com/portfolio) page.
2. Under `Manage Assets`, click the **OFFRAMP TO BANK** button. This will open a [Offramp to Bank Request](https://forms.zohopublic.com/carbonmark/form/OfframptoBankRequest/formperma/l1l1dm5JWpRBREjJGrBJyiUjPVn2C9QwJogKMCFkJYQ) form page.
3. Complete and **submit the form**. The Carbonmark team reviews the form information and creates a customer entry in our secure Bridge Dashboard app. We then send you an email outlining the remaining process and steps. This email includes links to the following **tasks you must complete** (needed for US and SEPA):
   1. Accept terms of service
   2. Add customer details
   3. Add source of funds
4. Once the tasks are completed successfully, your **customer status** inside the Bridge Dashboard app will be `active`.
5. The next step is to create a **Payment Route**. The Carbonmark team will work with you to collect the information required (essentially destination banking details).
6. Once the payment route is created, this will generate a **Deposit Address** that can be used in the Carbonmark app for the offramp transfer.

See [using-deposit-address.md](using-deposit-address.md "mention") page for how to use the deposit address in Carbonmark.&#x20;
