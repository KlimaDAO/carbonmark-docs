# API Checkout Service (beta)

The Checkout Service is a REST API that can be used to create unique payment links (powered by Stripe). These payment links allow your users to buy and retire carbon credits by entering their payment details.

The developer provides a credit and a quantity, and the service will respond with a unique URL. When the user navigates to this URL and completes payment, the offset transaction is initiated.

This is the **fastest path** for developers who want to provide their users access to the Carbonmark supply of carbon credits without building a custom payment processing flow themselves.
