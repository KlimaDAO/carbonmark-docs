# API Checkout Service (beta)

The Checkout Service is a REST API that can be used to create unique payment links (powered by Stripe). These payment links allow your users to buy and retire carbon credits by entering their payment details.

The developer provides a credit and a quantity, and the service will respond with a unique URL. When the user navigates to this URL and completes payment, the offset transaction is initiated.

This is the **fastest path** for developers who want to provide their users access to the Carbonmark supply of carbon credits without building a custom payment processing flow themselves.

### Availability and Access

The **Carbonmark API Checkout Service** is currently a beta product (limited release) and not in general availability.&#x20;

If you are interested in the Checkout Service and would like to learn more about how it could be integrated with your application, please reach out to our team to [**schedule a meeting / demo**](https://meetings-eu1.hubspot.com/liamellul/request-demo?uuid=2aa084bd-abc9-4bc2-b682-c2238171c102). Alternatively you can send us inquiries and questions through our [**contact**](https://share-eu1.hsforms.com/1RWJWvyrHT1C\_an4cZOHH3gfhhlr) form.&#x20;
