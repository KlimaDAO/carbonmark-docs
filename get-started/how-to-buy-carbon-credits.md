# How to buy carbon credits

**To create a listing and sell carbon credits in the Marketplace, you first need to acquire tokens for a specific carbon offset project. There are two ways to do this in Carbonmark:**

* **Buying (redeeming) from a carbon pool**
* **Buying directly from a Marketplace seller**

### _OPTION #1:_ _Buy/redeem from a carbon pool_.

#### 1. Within the Marketplace, find a project you are interested in and click the project card to see the project details.

#### 2. On the project details page, find the Carbon Pool listing and click "BUY".

#### 3. During the beta phase of Carbonmark, we are leveraging the KlimaDAO retirement aggregator. At this point, you will therefore be directed to said retirement aggregator. The form will be pre-populated with the project you have selected. _Note that in future releases, the retirement aggregator functionality will be migrated to Carbonmark_.

#### 4. If you are not already logged in to the KlimaDAO app, you will need to LOGIN / CONNECT using the same login and wallet that you are using in Carbonmark.

#### 5. Once connected, enter the number of tonnes you would like to acquire.

#### 6. Based on the quantity entered, the "Cost" and "You receive" fields will be populated. Use the "Payment method" drop down menu to select your desired payment method for your carbon credits (in this example, USDC is used).
