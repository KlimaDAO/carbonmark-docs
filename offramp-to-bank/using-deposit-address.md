## Overview

Once you have completed the [onboarding.md](onboarding.md "mention") process, you will have received a unique **Deposit Address** (0x...1234) that is exclusively linked to your Bridge customer ID and bank payment route. You can use that Deposit Address to facilitate the USDC --> Fiat offramp from the [Carbonmark app](https://forms.zohopublic.com/carbonmark/form/OfframptoBankRequest/formperma/l1l1dm5JWpRBREjJGrBJyiUjPVn2C9QwJogKMCFkJYQ).

## Process

1. Once the onboarding steps are complete, Carbonmark will send you an email with:
   1. **Deposit address** (i.e. 0x##...####).
   2. **Payment instructions PDF**; which includes the following information:
