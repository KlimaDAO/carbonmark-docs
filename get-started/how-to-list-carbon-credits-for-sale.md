# How to list carbon credits for sale

#### 1. To list and sell carbon credits on Carbonmark there are two prerequisites:

* #### You must have a [fully completed Profile](https://www.carbonmark.com/blog/how-to-create-and-edit-your-profile).
* #### You must have carbon tokens (for example, TCO2's or C3T's) in your wallet. See the [How to buy carbon credits](https://www.carbonmark.com/blog/how-to-buy-carbon-credits) article for more details.

#### 2. A listing can be created from your [Profile](https://www.carbonmark.com/users/login) or [Portfolio](https://www.carbonmark.com/portfolio) page. This guide will focus on navigating to these places from the marketplace.

#### 3. From the marketplace, click "Portfolio".

{% hint style="info" %}
**What does expiration mean?**

Listings on Carbonmark have a default 90-day expiration date or lifespan from the date of creation. Once this period ends, a listing becomes expired and is no longer available for purchase. Listers can opt to change their expiration date before a listing expires.
{% endhint %}

#### 5. A "Create a Listing" window will appear, in which the "Select Project" field will be pre-selected. Enter the total amount of tonnes you would like to sell. Your available quantity to list will be shown. You must list at least 1 tonne of carbon.

#### 7. The next steps are to approve and submit the listing transaction. The window will show a summary of the transaction; if any of the information does not look correct, click "GO BACK" to make listing modifications. If this is your first time creating a listing, you will need to first APPROVE the contract transaction with your wallet. Once that is complete you then need to SUBMIT the transaction.

#### Troubleshooting

**I created a new listing but it does not seem to appear in the marketplace or my profile**

If the transaction to create your new listing has been confirmed, the Carbonmark smart contract has recorded it and your listing will appear shortly. However, due to technical complexities in the background, your listing might not be visible to you right away. In this case, please allow a few minutes to pass.&#x20;
