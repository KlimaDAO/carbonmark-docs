# Provide ECO API

Any application – whether it is your own, or a part of SAP BTP – can become a gateway for organizational sustainability.

Provide ECO API enables developers to tap into instant, fractionalized, auditable digital carbon retirements.

Provide ECO API never requires users to hold any digital assets - abstracting away blockchain network functionality and offering convenient billing and invoicing options.
