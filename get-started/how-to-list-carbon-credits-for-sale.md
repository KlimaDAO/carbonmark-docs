# How to list carbon credits for sale

#### 1. To list and sell carbon credits on Carbonmark there are two prerequisites:

* #### You must have a [fully completed Profile](https://www.carbonmark.com/blog/how-to-create-and-edit-your-profile).
* #### You must have carbon tokens (for example, TCO2's or C3T's) in your wallet. See the [How to buy carbon credits](https://www.carbonmark.com/blog/how-to-buy-carbon-credits) article for more details.

_**Do listings expire?**_

**Yes, Listings on Carbonmark have a default 90-day expiration date** or lifespan from the date of creation. Once this period ends, a listing becomes expired and is no longer available for purchase. Sellers can opt to edit their listing before a listing expires.
{% endhint %}

#### 2. A listing can be created from your [Profile](https://www.carbonmark.com/users/login) or [Portfolio](https://www.carbonmark.com/portfolio) page. This guide will focus on navigating to these places from the marketplace.

#### 3. From the marketplace, click "Portfolio".

#### Troubleshooting

**I created a new listing but it does not seem to appear in the marketplace or my profile**

If the transaction to create your new listing has been confirmed, the Carbonmark smart contract has recorded it and your listing will appear shortly.&#x20;

However, due to technical complexities in the background, your listing might not be visible to you right away. In this case, please allow a few minutes to pass.&#x20;
