* Accept the necessary permissions for the Carbonmark app and click `Install`.  \

* Copy in your **Carbonmark login account address** into `Destination Carbonmark Account Address`.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**IMPORTANT**: Although you will still need to review the proposed transfer within your ICR organization to finalize, **if credits are sent to the incorrect Carbonmark account address** those credits are <mark style="color:red;">**irretrievable**</mark>.  \
\
<mark style="color:red;">**PLEASE**</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">double check the account address</mark> you enter to confirm you have control of that account address.

* All requests will appear in your organization's inventory page, including past accepted and declined requests. Unconfirmed transfers will have an `Accept` button to the far right of the transfer indicated by the red arrow (all the below transfers have already been accepted or declined and thus have no confirmation button).
